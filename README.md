### OVERVIEW
- **Foundation in General Relativity:** We first laid the groundwork for the General Theory of Relativity. We gained insights into the importance of tensors, used to describe various higher-dimensional quantities. We learned how gravity can be explained in terms of the curvature of spacetime using the metric tensor and the Riemann curvature tensor. We also explored the concepts of Minkowski spacetime. Additionally, we learned how to define geodesic equations for any curve using parallel transport with a covariant derivative. In studying the covariant derivative, we were introduced to connections, particularly Christoffel symbols (or Christoffel connections), which are metric-compatible and torsion-free. Following this, we learned about geodesic deviations and then moved towards Einstein's equations, where we saw the relationship between the curvature of spacetime and mass and energy.

- **Black Holes and Spacetime Metrics:** With a deeper understanding of General Relativity, we focused on black holes, specifically Schwarzschild black holes. We examined the Schwarzschild metric in different coordinate systems, such as Tortoise coordinates, Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates, and Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates. We then explored the Kruskal diagram and the basics of the Penrose diagram.

- **Coding in Python:** Finally, to apply our knowledge, I coded in Python using the EinsteinPy library, which is designed to solve equations in General Relativity. I used the library to calculate Christoffel symbols and the Riemann tensor for a given metric.
